        <h4>Unions</h4>
        Unions provide more flexibility in declaring new types. 
        Instead of adding code to try to fully handle the case of one or 
        more types, an additional type can be defined to be one of the 
        desired types. [ex] It can also be used to ensure that a variable 
        contains one of a limited number of valid inputs. [ex]
    </div>

    <div>
        <h4>Generics</h4>
        Generics provide a way to implement variables 
        consistently within types, when the type of variable is not 
        known at compilation time. [ex]
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <h4>Type System and Type Shapes</h4>
        Typescript uses a structural rather than a nominal type system. 
        This means that the compiler determines type relationships based 
        on the properties of an object, and not a type label. In fact, 
        types are not present in any way at runtime, they are only used 
        during compilation. As a result, objects that contain the same 
        properties as a certain type, but that are never defined to be of 
        that type, can still be treated as such. [ex] 
    </div>
  
    <div>
        Another surprising implication is that the shape of an object 
        only requires a subset of the properties to match. [ex]
    </div>
