    <h2>More on Types</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <h4>Unions</h4>
        <div class="flexed">
            Unions provide more flexibility in declaring new types. 
            Instead of adding code to try to fully handle the case of one or 
            more types, an additional type can be defined to be one of the 
            desired types. <br>

        <div class="flexed">
            It can also be used to ensure that a variable 
            contains one of a limited number of valid inputs. <br>

        <h4>Generics</h4>
        <div class="flexed">
            Generics provide a way to implement variables 
            consistently within types, when the type of variable is not 
            known at compilation time.

        <h4>Type System and Type Shapes</h4>
        <div class="flexed">
            Typescript uses a structural rather than a nominal type system. 
            This means that the compiler determines type relationships based 
            on the properties of an object, and not a type label. In fact, 
            types are not present in any way at runtime, they are only used 
            during compilation. As a result, objects that contain the same 
            properties as a certain type, but that are never defined to be of 
            that type, can still be treated as such.

        <div class="flexed">
            Another surprising implication is that the shape of an object 
            only requires a subset of the properties to match. <br>
