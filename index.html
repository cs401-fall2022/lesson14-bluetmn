            Javascript is an extremely pervasive and useful programming language to provide interactivity to a webpage. 
            The origins of Javascript however did not indicate that it would become as widely used in applications today. 
            As a result, Javascript has some aspects that are not entirely conducive to producing code efficiently. 
            One of these is the lack of “typing”; javascript does have types, but there is no check to see if they are used consistently. 
            This is where Typescript comes in.

            Typescript is a superscript of Javascript, meaning that all valid Javascript code is also valid Typescript code. 
            The difference is that Typescript has functionality to check if variable types are used consistently throughout the program, 
            and to avoid simple bugs that can be hard to track down. Typescript is an asset to development with Javascript, and in this 
            tutorial the Typescript functionality will be explained.
