        <h4>Configuration File</h4>
        <div>
            Typescript uses an input file called tsconfig.json to pass
            information to the compiler on what files it should take in, 
            what settings should be used to compile, and where the compiled
            js files should be placed. [ex] 
        </div>

        <h4>Transfering to Typescript</h4>
        <div>
            To transfer a project to typescript, rename the files from
            *.js to *.ts. Because all javascript is also typescript, this step is sufficient
            enough. However, to fully make use of typscript's utility, strictness
            options can be adjusted to ensure that the transfered code is rigorous
            and error free.
        </div>

        <h4>Strictness Options</h4>
        <div>
            Some of the options that will affect how the code is compiled,
            and what errors are not allowed are shown below:
            <ul>
                <li>"allowUnreachableCode" - set this to false to avoid code that
                    will never get executed no matter what 
                </li>
                <li>
                    "noImplicitAny" - this option will not allow variables 
                    that have the type "any" arising from situtations when
                    the compiler cannot tell from declaration or context.
                </li>
                <li>
                    "noImplicitReturns" - this option will not allow functions 
                    to omit returns, avoiding bugs related to this.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            This list shows just a few examples of the strictness 
            options of typescript and why it is a useful tool.
